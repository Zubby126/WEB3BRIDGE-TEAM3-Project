            <h1>What is Blockchain</h1>

            <h3>"Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed digital ledger technology that records transactions across many computers in such a way that the record is secure, transparent, and immutable (cannot be altered). It operates without the need for a central authority, making it a revolutionary tool for various industries, most notably finance, supply chain, and data management."</h3>

                <h2>Key Concepts of Blockchain:</h2>

                <ol class="details-container">
                    <li>
                        <p>Decentralization:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Traditional databases (like those used by banks) are centralized, meaning one entity controls the system. In contrast, blockchain operates on a decentralized network of computers (often called nodes) that work together to validate and record transactions.</li>
                            <li>No single point of control exists, reducing the risk of manipulation or failure due to a single compromised system.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>Distributed Ledger:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <l1>All nodes in the blockchain network have access to the entire ledger, meaning every transaction is recorded across the network. If one node fails or is compromised, the ledger remains intact on the other nodes.</l1>
                            <l1>Everyone in the network has a synchronized copy of the ledger, increasing transparency.</l1>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>Transparency and Immutability:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Once a transaction is recorded on the blockchain, it is very difficult to alter. Every transaction is cryptographically secured and linked to the previous one (hence the term "blockchain"), creating a chain of information that is highly resistant to tampering.</li>
                            <li>This property makes blockchain trustworthy for recording sensitive information, as any change would be visible to the entire network.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>Consensus Mechanism:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>For transactions to be added to the blockchain, there needs to be consensus among the network participants. Different blockchains use different consensus algorithms, such as:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Proof of Work (PoW): Requires solving complex computational problems to validate transactions (used in Bitcoin).</li>
                                    <li>Proof of Stake (PoS): Involves participants staking their cryptocurrency to validate transactions (used in Ethereum 2.0).</li>
                                    <li>Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), and others.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>Smart Contracts:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A key feature of many blockchains, particularly Ethereum, is the use of smart contracts—self-executing contracts where the terms are directly written into lines of code.</li>
                            <li>Smart contracts automatically execute actions (such as transferring funds or verifying transactions) when predefined conditions are met, removing the need for intermediaries like lawyers or brokers.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>Cryptographic Security:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Blockchain uses cryptographic techniques to secure data. Public-key cryptography ensures that only those with the correct private key can access or authorize transactions, while the public key serves as an address visible to all.</li>
                            <li>The cryptographic nature of blockchain ensures security, authenticity, and integrity of transactions.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                   
                </ol>

                <ol class="details-container">

                    <h2>Types of Blockchain:</h2>

                    <li>
                        <p>Public Blockchains:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Open and permissionless networks where anyone can join and participate (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum). Transactions are visible to everyone, making the system transparent.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>Private Blockchains:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Restricted and permission-based, where only authorized participants can join the network. Companies often use private blockchains to maintain control while still benefiting from the technology’s security features.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>Consortium Blockchains:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>A hybrid model where a group of organizations controls the network, balancing decentralization and control. It’s often used in industries where different companies work together (e.g., supply chain management).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
